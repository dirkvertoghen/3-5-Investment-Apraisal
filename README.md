3. simple payback
   A company is evaluating a project with an investment of $40,000. $17,500 profit is expected to be generated each year for eight years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis over the life of the project.
Required: Estimate the simple payback period.

4.You are required to assess whether the company is expected to accept or reject the following investment project given that the payback period for all investments should not exceed 4 years:
1) the cost of a new machine: $95,000
2) expected useful life of the machine: 4 years
3) anticipated scrap value of the machine: $15,000.
Furthermore, the company's finance director expects that annual net operating cash inflows for the years 1 to 4 will be as follows: $15,000, $35,000, $40,000, $10,000.

   Consider the Simple payback method –
   example (2), and assume that the discounted payback period for the company’s investment projects should not exceed 4 years. Cost of capital applicable to projects with similar risk and return characteristics is 6%. Evaluate whether or not the given
investment project is going to be accepted.

8. An initial investment of $2,000 in a project yields cash inflows of $500, $500, $600, $600 and $440 at 12 months intervals. There is no scrap value. Funds are available to finance the project at 12%.
Required:
Decide whether the project is worthwhile, using:
(a) net present value approach
(b) internal rate of return approach.

9. A project requires an initial investment of $24,000 and will generate following annual cash flows in years 1 to 5 (in US$): 7,800; 6,000; 4,200; 7,400; 9,200. The cost of capital is 10%.
Required:
1) Find the NPV and the IRR of the project.
2) Assume that funds can be borrowed at 10% whilst the reinvestment rate for positive cash flows is 12%. What is the MIRR?

10.  A company is considering investing $4.5m in a project to achieve an annual increase in revenues over the next five years of $2m. The project will lead to an increase in wage costs of $0.4m per year and will also require expenditure of $0.3m per year to maintain the level of existing assets to be used on the project. Additional investment in working capital equivalent to 10% of the increase in revenue will need to be in place at the start of each year. The real cost of capital of the company is 8%.

If net trading cash flow from the project is $16,000 pa and the cost of capital is 8% calculate the free cash flows and hence the net present value (NPV) of the project.

12. A project will require an investment in a new asset of $10,000. It will be used on a project for four years after which it will be disposed of on the final day of year 4. Tax is payable at 30% one year in arrears, and capital allowances are available at 25% reducing balance. Net operating flows from the project are expected to be $4,000 per year.

13.  Single factor capital rationing – example
The Board of Technology Partners is evaluating several project. Given that the management has a total capital budget of $72 million and that the projects are not divisible, find the optimal combination of projects that it can invest in. Information regarding which is given in the following table:

15.Lease or buy decision - Test
A firm has decided to acquire a new machine. The machine would cost $6.4 million, its economic life is estimated to be 5 years.
Tax-allowable depreciation of 25% p.a. on a reducing balance basis is available. Taxation of 30% is payable on operating cash flows, one year in arrears. The firm intends to finance the new asset by means of a 5-year fixed interest loan at a pre-tax cost of 11.4% pa, principal repayable in 5 years. As an alternative, a leasing company has proposed a lease over 5 years at $1.42 million pa payable in advance. There will be no scrap value of the machine under each financing alternative.
Required: Evaluate the two options for acquiring the machine and advise the company on the best alternative.

16. Replacement cycle decision - test
A machine costs $20,000. The following information is also available: Running costs (payable at the end of the year): $5,000 and $5,500 for the years 1 and 2. If replaced after first year the trade-in allowance is set at $16,000, and if after the second year - at $13,000.
Required: Calculate the optimal replacement cycle if the cost of capital is 10%.

17. Risk and uncertainty – test
Dralin Co is considering an investment of $460,000 in a non-current asset expected to generate substantial cash inflows over the next five years. Unfortunately, the annual cash flows from this investment are uncertain, but the following probability distribution has been established:
.
              Annual cash flow ($)    Probability
              50.000                     0,3
              100.000                    0,5
              150.000                    0,2

At the end of its five-year life, the asset is expected to sell for $40,000. The cost of capital is 5%. Assess whether the investment should be undertaken?

18. Risk and uncertainty 
Dark Ages Co, whose cost of capital is 10%, is considering a project with the following expected annual free cash flows in the years 0 to 3: - 10000; 7000; 5000; 5000. The applicable discount rate is 10%. However, because of the uncertainty about the future cash receipts, the management decides to reduce them to ‘certainty-equivalents’ by taking only 70%, 60% and 50% of the years 1, 2 and 3 cash flows respectively. The risk-free rate is 5%.
Required: On the basis of the information set out above, assess whether the project is worthwhile.


19. Sensitivity analysis – Example
Alice has just set up a new company and estimates that the cost of capital is 14%. Her first project involves investing of $80,000 in equipment with a life of 5 years and a final scrap value of $7,000. The equipment will produce 16,000 units p.a. generating a contribution of $2.45 each. She estimates that additional fixed costs will be $15,000 p.a.
Required:

      (a) Determine, on the basis of the above figures, whether the project is worthwhile
      (b) Calculate the sensitivity to change of: 1) the initial investment; 2) the sales volume p.a.; 3) the contribution p.u.; 4) the fixed costs p.a.; 5) the scrap value; 6) the cost of capital

            Sensitivity analysis - shortcomings 
            1. Deals with changes in isolation, and ignores interactions between variables
            2. Assumes that specified changes persist throughout the project lifetime
            3. May reveal as critical, factors over which managers have no control
            4. Does not provide a decision rule
            5. Gives no indication of the likelihood of the variations
